<b>DESCRIPTION :</b>

Implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in Python.

<b>HOW DOES BUBBLE SORT WORK ?</b>

Bubble sort basically works by exchanging or swapping elements in an array iteratively until the specific order (ascending or descending) is attained. It compares adjacent elements in the array, and makes a swap until the array is completely sorted. Bubble sort is simple to implement and works optimally for smaller arrays.

<b>PERFORMANCE</b>
<ul>

<li>Worst-case time complexity :- O(n ^ 2)</li>
<li>Space complexity :- O(1) </li>
</ul>

<b>OUTPUT - For a random list of 100 elements</b>
