<b>DESCRIPTION :</b>

Implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm in Python.

<b>HOW DOES QUICK SORT WORK ?</b>

The Quick sort algorithm is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. It also works using a divide-and-conquer algorithm. The initial step is to select a pivot (typically the last element in the array), after this pivot is selected, The array is partitioned in such a manner that elements smaller than the selected pivot element are placed on the left position and the elements larger than the selected pivot element are placed on the right. Pivot elements are then chosen for the left and right sub-parts again, and the partitioning technique explained above continues. This is done recursively until each sub-part is made up of one element. At this point, the array/list is finally sorted.
