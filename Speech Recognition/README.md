<b>DESCRIPTION</b> :

Working with Speech Recognition APIs in Python. I evaluated the performance and limitations of each API I was able to test. Most of them i.e. Google Cloud API and IBM required further authentication so I wasn't able to test those. I however tested the Google Web Speech API, Microsoft Bing API, CMU Sphinx.
